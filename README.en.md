# daihuo-fanpai · Viral E-commerce Short-Video Replication Skill

Reverse-engineer a viral product video → migrate it to *your* product → regenerate shots with Jimeng/Seedance → dub, assemble, score → **deliver a ready-to-edit JianYing (CapCut CN) draft or a subtitled final cut**.
An **agent-driven** pipeline (built for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) and similar agents) where every stage emits a human-reviewable file.

> **Core insight**: when agents replicate worse than humans, the culprit is **not the video model — it's the "analysis → prompt" hand-off that drops details and actions** ("orange herbal water", "a hand tearing the sea cucumber open" get summarized away). Every design decision here defends one rule: **carry the analyzed subject + action + key details verbatim into generation**, backed by a completeness gate, a human-review checkpoint, and an AI judge.

## Modes

| Mode | What it does | Judge score (90-pt rubric) |
|---|---|---|
| **A — Faithful replica** | Same script, same product | 54/90 |
| **Product migration** | Same structure, your product/packaging | text-faithful packaging |
| **B — Cross-category** | Borrow a viral structure from another category + methodology-driven script rewrite | 69/90 |
| **A — Multi-character skit** | 3-character office-comedy replica (multi-anchor cast + original-audio lip sync) | fidelity 63/100 |
| **A — Batch production** | Whole-catalog replication of one product, fully automated SOP | 16 deliveries in one day, 40-60 min each at cruise |

Higher = more likely to scale in paid traffic. Understanding-driven reconstruction beats mechanical copying. Story-driven originals score low on the ads rubric by nature — judge them by fidelity instead.

## Pipeline

```
0 doctor → 1 seed_reverse → [1b dual reverse: k3_reverse + merge_reverse evidence adjudication]
→ 1.5 needed_assets (which product photos to prepare)
→ 2 plan_segments (completeness gate + human review) → [skits: patch_cast anchors + hard cast-count constraint]
→ [Mode B: localize_seed / localize_apply + review]
→ 3 tts_segments (multi-speaker + pronunciation fixes | audio reuse: cut_audio with 2-second upload gate)
→ 4 gen_segments (Jimeng / Volcano / Xiaoyunque backends; auto retry on moderation & network flaps;
                  post-download decode check catches corrupted streams)
→ 5 assemble → [skits: qc_lipsync frame-level lip QC → redraw dirty segments]
→ 6 judge (uploads final AND source video for a real fidelity comparison)
→ 7 export_subs (SRT + on-screen-text checklist) → 8 deliver (★JianYing draft | burned-subtitle final)
```

### Two routes, picked by `route.py`

```
reverse → profile → ★route.py (classify the film)
            ├─ main speaker ON camera (host monologue) → audio-driven (the pipeline above)
            └─ main speaker OFF camera (camera operator / narrator)
                 → verify_dialogue (3-source reconciliation) → human-corrected script
                 → script_first.py  (dialogue goes INTO the prompt; the model speaks it itself)
                 → gen_jimeng_par.py (parallel generation)
```

**Why split.** Off-camera speech has no face to attach to, so an audio-driven model can only
assign it to someone who *is* on camera — that is the mechanism behind "the wrong person is
talking". Put the dialogue in the prompt and let the model generate the voice, and attribution
cannot be wrong, because the model decides who speaks. Measured on the same film (two arms,
n=3, one shared frame grid): frames where an on-camera person's mouth is open **during
off-camera speech** went from **27% (range 1–11, one roll in three blows up) to 5–13%, with no
blow-up in six rolls**; dialogue was verbatim in 8/8 segments.

**But do not use it for on-camera hosts.** There the voice must belong to that face, and with a
single speaker there is no attribution ambiguity to fix — the benefit does not exist while the
cost (losing the original voice) still applies. *The same change is a cure for one film type and
a poison for another, which is why routing must come before generation.*

⚠ The two backends have **opposite** language rules: **Jimeng requires Chinese prompts**
(English makes it invent its own lines during silent windows); **h3 requires English body text**
following the official spec (`<d>dialogue</d>` + `(Sx)` speaker IDs + `[audio reference]`).

Stages hand off only through JSON files/folders — **pluggable**: swap the VLM, the video model, or the TTS by rewriting one script (contracts in `DESIGN.md`).

## Configuration (`config.py`, all env-overridable, no hardcoded secrets)

| Item | Purpose | Setup |
|---|---|---|
| Jimeng Dreamina CLI | video generation (lip-sync requires it; maestro VIP) | `curl -fsSL https://jimeng.jianying.com/cli \| bash`, then `dreamina login` |
| Volcano Ark | analysis/judge (Seed 2.1 Pro) + optional generation (Seedance 2.0) | `export ARK_API_KEY=...`; model via `ARK_SEED_MODEL` |
| CosyVoice (optional) | local dubbing; graceful fallbacks if absent | `export COSYVOICE_HOME=...` |
| pyJianYingDraft (optional) | JianYing draft delivery; falls back to `--mode final` | own venv; drafts dir via `DAIHUO_JY_DRAFTS` |
| ffmpeg + Python `requests` | cutting / assembly / HTTP | — |

> Everything talks to mainland-China endpoints directly — **no proxy needed**. Set `DAIHUO_DOWNLOAD_PROXY` only if CDN downloads fail on your network.

### `assets.json`: the product profile (switch categories without touching code)

```jsonc
{"host_anchor": "assets/host.jpg",
 "host_desc": "shoulder-length black hair, cream knit top",   // pinned into every host shot → no wardrobe drift
 "product_desc": "XX sea cucumber, navy-gold packaging",
 "products": {"hero": "...", "giftbox": "...", "innerbox": "..."},
 "forms": {"hero": ["serum","dropper"], "bottle": ["glass bottle","pump"]},  // form aliases per category
 "product_verbs": ["apply","dab","spray"]}                    // verbs the completeness gate checks
```

## Methodology ammo pack (not included)

Mode B script rewriting expects a `qianchuan/` methodology pack (topic selection / sentence patterns / cross-category SOP / scoring rubric / compliance red lines), distilled from paid courses — **not in this repo**. Bring your own per the `QC_FILES` convention in `localize_seed.py`; Mode A never needs it.

## Two delivery shapes (`deliver.py`)

- **JianYing draft (recommended)**: the pipeline's segment structure flows straight into the editor — video track laid segment by segment (boundaries = cut points), dub track aligned, per-sentence editable subtitles, the source video's on-screen text placed as a reference track, plus an empty BGM track. Media is copied into the draft folder (self-contained). Verified on JianYing 10.7: it encrypts drafts *on save* but happily *reads* plaintext drafts; if a future version breaks this, fall back to `final`.
- **Burned-subtitle final**: subtitles (+ optional `--bgm`) burned onto the neutral master `FULL.mp4`, which itself stays subtitle-free and BGM-free forever — it is the judge input and regression baseline; all cosmetics happen downstream.

## Multi-character skits

Beyond single-host videos, a 3-character office comedy has been replicated end-to-end: per-segment cast anchors + per-character persona clauses + a **hard character-count constraint** (without it the model hallucinates extra people — now baked into `patch_cast.py`); product images are stripped from pre-reveal segments to protect the suspense. Speaker/lip mis-assignment now has a full treatment (error rate 28% → 6% in practice): frame-level lip QC (`qc_lipsync.py`, source-video frames as ground truth) locates dirty segments → redraw loop (1-2 draws each, keep the better take) absorbs random errors → sticky errors (same line wrong twice) get timestamped for a manual fix in the draft. Hard lesson: **never** let a video model transcribe your AI footage as QC — it hallucinates entire lines. Dual-reverse note: the two reverse models fail in mirror image (Seed: timing/burned-in-text bleed; K3: entity hallucination — it has read a soap as a steamed bun), so trust K3 for camera timelines, trust Seed + **source-frame verification** for entities, and adjudicate field by field with `merge_reverse.py`.

## Notes

- Billing: Jimeng CLI uses a monthly credit pool; Volcano Ark bills per token (`--i2v-backend ark` offloads i2v shots).
- **Backend boundary (policy)**: Volcano rejects any reference image containing a human face (even AI-generated photoreal ones) — host/person segments are Jimeng-CLI-only; product-only segments can use either backend.
- **Compliance is on you**: no medical claims, no fabricated endorsements, real prices only.
